Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a Junior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. 

I'm an aspiring Product Manager who is excited about health tech. I want to work with brilliant people who build things that improve people's physical and mental health. I'm especially excited about wearables, AR/VR, and leveraging AI/ML (sorry) to make whatever we're building better. 

I'm spending my summer at UC Berkeley working at an open-source health tech initiative within [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). It's called [JupyterHealth](https://jupyterhealth.org/), and we're trying reshape how healthcare systems can use data from consumer-facing wearables. 

During the school year, I'm an undergraduate TA for [EECS 280](https://eecs280.org/), the 3rd largest course at Michigan. I teach a lab section and do whatever I can to be an impactful teacher and mentor for my students.

I'm a freelance Software Engineeer for [Focus for Democracy](https://www.focus4democracy.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to empowering political donors to make the most impactful contributions possible to strengthen democracy. I write code and build internal apps to help them raise more money.

I'm also the Technical Product Manager for the [Michigan Fashion Media Summit](https://www.michiganfashionmediasummit.com/), a student-run organization that organizes the largest collegiate conference for students interested in working in fashion. This year we had more than 600 attendees. Every year it gets better (somehow).

I also run the Asia section of the Michigan Journal of International Affairs. I have an awesome team of writers who are probably the only other people at Michigan subscribed to The Economist.  

In my free time I love to read, ride my bike, do yoga, compete in hackathons, watch movies, cook, hike, and do the NYT Crossword. I nerd out about public transportation, font choices, and art.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at the bottom of this page. Always happy to chat :).

 
Some people who inspire me are:
- [Jeremy Bailenson](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jeremy-bailenson), Founding Director of Stanford's [Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL)](https://vhil.stanford.edu/). If I could have 1/10th the positive impact he has had on the world, I could die happy.
- Soren Gordhamer. He runs [Wisdom 2.0](https://www.wisdom2summit.com/), a conference where people can come together and hear from some of the leading voices in wellness, and explore how to live mindfully in a technology-rich age. I had the pleasure of working there last summer.
